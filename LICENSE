The parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive agreement among the parties and supersedes all proposals and prior agreements whether written or oral, and all other communications among the parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. 
This Agreement cannot be modified except in writing and signed by both parties. Failure by either party at any time to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver by such party of such provision nor in any way affect the validity of this Agreement. 
The invalidity of singular provisions does not affect the validity of the entire understanding. The parties are obligated, however, to replace the invalid provisions by a regulation which comes closest to the economic intent of the invalid provision. The same shall apply mutatis mutandis in case of a gap.
